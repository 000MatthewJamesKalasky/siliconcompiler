**How the Documentation is Organized**

.. rst-class:: page-break

- The :ref:`User Guide` is useful for users who would like to start running SiliconCompiler with their own designs using pre-defined build flows. Useful subsections include :ref:`quickstart` and :ref:`tutorials`
- The :ref:`Advanced Guide <advanced>` is for users who are already familiar with the basics in User Guide and would like to build their own flows or add additional functionality to existing flows.
- The :ref:`references` section contains useful lookup information, like :ref:`building_blocks` and :ref:`API references <api_refs>` which are helpful to search through.

**Getting Help**

.. rst-class:: page-break

- :ref:`glossary` 
- :ref:`faq`
- Last but not least, `file an issue <https://github.com/siliconcompiler/siliconcompiler/issues>`_ if you can't find what you're looking for, or something isn't working as expected. The SiliconCompiler team is happy to help!
