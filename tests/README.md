## Test guidelines


### Tools
 * These are simple unit tests that check installation and basic functionality
 * One file per tool
 * A test file can have multiple tests
 * Name of file should be test_<name-of-tool>.py
 * Place input data in tests/data directory
 * Use existing data files if possible
 * All tests must at a minimum check that output file was produced
